Installation process
--------------------
The installation process is as simple as extracting the archive or checking
out the code from SVN to wherever you want. You may have to perform additional
setup steps depending on the operating system you're running though.
Each processor may also require additional setup. See below for the
installation instructions of the included processors.

Make sure you've got Python 2.5 installed. If you've got a different version
installed, you can install Python 2.5 next to it.

| OS-specific additional instructions                                        |
==============================================================================

Linux
-----
Linux is fully supported and requires additional setup.
On Linux, it is necessary to install pyinotify if you're running kernel 2.6.13
or higher. This will allow you to take advantage of inotify to detect changes
on the file system as opposed to polling.
You must install version 0.8.0 or better (it has only been tested with 0.9.6
but the API has remained the same according to the documentation).
On Debian/Ubuntu, you can run
  sudo aptitude install python-pyinotify
to install pyinotify. But please ensure this version is new enough. On other
distributions, follow these instructions:
  http://trac.dbzteam.org/pyinotify/wiki/InstallPyinotify


Mac OS X
---------
Mac OS X is fully supported and requires no additional setup.


Windows
-------
Windows is not yet supported.
The necessary abstractions for Windows are built in, but the daemon has not
yet been tested in it.
