Questions for Steve Souders:
- Why hardcode the domain name in window.postMessage() calls when you could also just use document.location?
- Why hardcode scriptUrl? It should be in EPISODES.compatScriptUrl?
- Should the first byte always be measured explicitly?
  http://stevesouders.com/episodes/episodes.js suggests you shouldn't: it estimates the start time based on a cookie – BUT WHAT WITH THE FIRST TIME?
  http://stevesouders.com/episodes/example.php suggests you should measure it explicitly.
  But firstbyte only starts measuring from the front-end. I also want to measure
  the back-end. So I'm now setting EPISODES.backendStartTime from the back-end.
- Is http://stevesouders.com/episodes/episodes.js released under the GPL or the public domain?
- Should a domready event (besides the pageready) episode be added to episodes.js?



Problems-that-need-thought:
- Handle dev/staging/production.
- Measuring CSS and JS files load times requires cooperation of the themes -> theme layer.
- Encourage module developers to support EPISODES when present. Should degrade gracefully.
  -> lazy loading callbacks
  -> own episodes
- On the first page load, the cookie is not yet set and therefor the pageready,
  backend and totaltime times cannot be calculated. Also a problem when cookies are disabled



Know-how-to-do-but-not-yet-done:
- Add a setting that allows you to serve the file from a central location (e.g. when Google starts hosting Episodes).
- Add a setting that allows you to enable/disable per-behavior measurements.



Drupal core ideas:
- Not only provide Drupal.behaviors, but Drupal.transformations (carousel etc) and Drupal.lazy.



Insights
- Generating the back-end start time on the server can never work reliably because
  the clocks of the client (browser) and server can never be in sync precise enough.
- Even just measuring the page execution time on the server cannot work
  because of this same reason. You can accurately measure this time, but you
  can't relate it to the measurements in the browser.
  (I implemented this using hook_boot() and hook_exit())
- RTT estimator cannot work either
