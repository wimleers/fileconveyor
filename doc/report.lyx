\begin_layout Standard
When a end user loads a web page, the time perceived by him until the page
 has loaded entirely is called the 
\emph on
end user response time
\emph default
.
 Unlike what you might think, the majority of this time isn't spent at the
 server, generating the page! The generating (back-end) and transport of
 the HTML document (front-end) is typically only 10-20% of the end user
 response time.
 The other 80-90% of the time is spent on loading the components (CSS stylesheet
s, JavaScript, images, movies, etc.) in the page (front-end only).

It should be obvious now that it's far more effective to focus on front-end
 performance than it is to focus on back-end performance, because it's got
 a greater potential.
 It's also easier to optimize than the back-end.

\begin_layout Standard
Page loading performance matters for a single reason:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Users care about performance!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your web site's visitors won't be timing the page loads themselves, but
 they will browse elsewhere when you're forcing them to wait too long.
 Fast web sites are rewarded, slow web sites are punished.
 Fast web sites get more visitors, have happier visitors and their visitors
 return more often.
 If the revenue of your company is generated through your web site, you'll
 want to make sure that page loading performance is as good as possible,
 because it will maximize your revenue as well.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, why is this important to Drupal – because this bachelor thesis is about
 improving Drupal's page loading performance in particular? Because then
 the Drupal Experience is better: a faster web site results in happier users
 and developers.
 If your site is a commercial one – either through ads or a store, then
 it also impacts your revenue.
 More generally, a faster Drupal would affect many:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Drupal is increasinly used for big, high-traffic web sites, thus a faster
 Drupal would affect a lot of people
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Drupal is still growing in popularity (according to its usage statistics,
 which only includes web sites with the Update Status module enabled, there
 are over 140,000 web sites as of February 22, 2009, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Drupal usage statistics"

\end_inset

) and would therefor affect ever more people
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Drupal is international, thanks to its i18n/L10n support, and thanks to
 that it's used for sites with very international audiences (whom face high
 network latencies) and developing countries (where low-speed internet connectio
ns are commonplace).
 A faster Drupal would make a big difference there as well.

Key Properties of a CDN
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Key-Properties-CDN"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'll repeat the definition from the terminology section:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
A content delivery network (CDN) is a collection of web servers distributed
 across multiple locations to deliver content more efficiently to users.
 The server selected for delivering content to a specific user is typically
 based on a measure of network proximity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's extremely hard to decide which CDN to use.
 In fact, by just looking at a CDN's performance, it's close to impossible
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cdn-comparing-1,cdn-comparing-2"

\end_inset

!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So you must look at the featureset – instead of performance – when deciding.
 Depending on your audience, the geographical spread (the number of PoPs
 around the world) may be very important to you.
 A 100% SLA is also nice to have.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

You may also choose a CDN based on the population methods it supports.
 There are two big categories here: 
\emph on
push
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
pull
\emph default
.
 Pull requires virtually no work on your side: all you have to do, is rewrite
 the URLs to your files.
 The CDN will then apply the 
\emph on
Origin Pull
\emph default
 technique and will periodically pull the files from the origin (that's
 your server).
 How often that is, depends on how you've configured headers (particularly
 the Expires headers).
 It of course also depends on the software driving the CDN – there is no
 standard in this field.
 It may also result in redundant traffic because files are being pulled
 from the origin server more often than they actually change, but this is
 a minor drawback in most situations.
 Push on the other hand, requires a fair amount of work on your side to
 sync files to the CDN.
 But you gain flexibility because you can decide when files are synced,
 how often and if any preprocessing should happen.
 That's much harder to do with Origin Pull CDNs.
 See table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Pull-versus-Push"

\end_inset

 for an overview on this.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

It should also be noted that some CDNs, if not most, support both Origin
 Pull and one or more push methods.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The last thing to consider is vendor lock-in.
 Some CDNs offer highly specialized features, such as video transcoding.
 If you then discover another CDN that is significantly cheaper, you cannot
 easily move, because you're depending on your current CDN's specific features.

Lord Kelvin

\begin_layout Standard
The same applies to page loading performance: if you can't measure it, you
 can't know which parts have the biggest effect and thus deserve your focus.
 So before doing any real work, we'll have to figure out which tools can
 help us analyzing page loading performance.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
In software engineering, 
\emph on
performance analysis, more commonly today known as profiling
\emph default
, is the investigation of a program's behavior using information gathered
 as the program executes.
 The 
\emph on
usual goal of performance analysis is to determine which sections of a program
 to optimize
\emph default
 — usually either to increase its speed or decrease its memory requirement
 (or sometimes both).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we'll go through a list of tools: UA Profiler, Cuzillion, YSlow, Hammerhead,
 Apache JMeter, Gomez/Keynote/WebMetrics/Pingdom and Jiffy/Episodes.
 As you can tell, it's a pretty long list, so I'll pick the tools I'll use
 while improving Drupal's page loading performance based on two factors:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How the tool could help improve Drupal core's page loading performance.

 is a crowd-sourced project for gathering browser performance characteristics
 (parallel connections, downloading scripts without blocking, caching, etc.).
 The tests run automatically when you navigate to the test page from any
 browser – this is why it's powered by crowdsourcing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's a handy, informative tool to find out which browser supports which
 features related to page loading performance.
\end_layout

Cuzillion 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 was introduced 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Cuzillion announcement"

\end_inset

 on April 25, 2008 so it is a relatively new tool.
 Its tag line, 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

‘cuz there are zillion pages to check
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 indicates what it's about: there are a lot of possible combinations of
 stylesheets, scripts and images.
 Plus they can be external or inline.
 And each combination has different effects.
 Finally, to further complicate the situation, all these combinations depend
 on the browser being used.
 It should be obvious that without Cuzillion, it's an insane job to figure
 out how each browser behaves:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Before I would open an editor and build some test pages.
 Firing up a packet sniffer I would load these pages in different browsers
 to diagnose what was going on.
 I was starting my research on advanced techniques for loading scripts without
 blocking and realized the number of test pages needed to cover all the
 permutations was in the hundreds.
 That was the birth of Cuzillion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cuzillion is not a tool that helps you analyze any 
\emph on
existing 
\emph default
web page.
 Instead, it allows you to analyze any combination of components.
 That means it's a 
\emph on
learning tool
\emph default
.
 You could also look at it as a 
\emph on
browser profiling tool
\emph default
 instead of all other listed tools, which are 
\emph on
page loading profiling tools
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's go through a simple example for a better understanding.
 How does the following combination of components (in the 
\family typewriter
<body>
\family default
 tag) behave in different browsers?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
an image on domain 1 with a 2 second delay
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
an inline script with a 2 second execution time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
an image on domain 1 with a 2 second delay
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First you create this setup in Cuzillion (see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "fig:Cuzillion"

\end_inset

).
 This generates a unique URL.
 You can then copy this URL to all browsers you'd like to test.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see, Safari and Firefox behave very differently.
 In Safari (see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "fig:Cuzillion-Safari"

\end_inset

), the loading of the first image seems to be deferred until the inline
 script has been executed.
 In Firefox (see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "fig:Cuzillion-Firefox"

\end_inset

), the first image is immediately rendered and after a delay of 2 seconds
 – indeed the execution time of the inline script – the second image is
 rendered.
 Without going into details about this, it should be clear that Cuzillion
 is a simple, yet powerful tool to learn about browser behavior, which can
 in turn help to improve the page loading performance.

\begin_layout Standard
YSlow 1.0 can only evaluate these 13 rules and has a hardcoded grading algorithm.
 You should also remember that YSlow just checks how well a web page implements
 these rules.
 It analyzes the content of your web page (and the headers that were sent
 with it).
 For example, it doesn't test the latency or speed of a CDN, it just checks
 if you are using one.
 As an example, because you have to tell YSlow (via Firefox' 
\family typewriter
about:config
\family default
) what the domain name of your CDN is, you can even fool YSlow into thinking
 any site is using a CDN: see

Since only YSlow 1.0 is available at the time of writing, I'll stick with
 that.
 It's a very powerful and helpful tool as it stands, it'll just get better.
 But remember the two caveats: it only verifies rules (it doesn't measure
 real-world performance) and some of the rules may not be relevant for your
 web site.

 extension that should be used

 developing.
 It measures how long a page takes to load and it can load a page multiple
 times, to calculate the average and mean page load times.
 Of course, this is a lot less precise than real-world profiling, but it
 allows you to profile while you're working.
 It's far more effective to prevent page loading performance problems due
 to changes in code, because you have the test results within seconds or
 minutes after you've made these changes!

, but then you have to load the page multiple times (i.e.

hammer 
\emph default
the server, this is where the name comes from).
 And you'd still have to set up the separate testing conditions for each
 page load: empty cache, primed cache and for the latter there are again
 two possible situations: disk cache 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 memory cache or just disk cache.
 Memory cache is of course faster than disk cache; that's also why that
 distinction is important.
 Finally, it supports exporting the resulting data into CSV format, so you
 could even create some tools to roughly track page loading performance
 throughout time.

 is an application 
\emph on
designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance
\emph default
.
 In the perspective of profiling page loading performance, the relevant
 features are: loading of web pages with and without its components and
 measuring the response time of just the HTML or the HTML and all the components
 it references.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, it has several severe limitations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Because it only measures from one location – the location from where it's
 run, it doesn't give a good big picture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It isn't an actual browser, so it doesn't download components referenced
 from CSS or JS files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Also because it isn't an actual browser, it doesn't behave the same as browsers
 when it comes to parallel downloads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It requires more setup than Hammerhead (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sub:Hammerhead"

\end_inset

), so it's less likely that a developer will make JMeter part of his workflow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can be very useful in case you're doing performance testing (How long
 does the back-end need to generate certain pages?), load testing (How many
 concurrent users can the back-end/server setup handle?) and stress testing
 (How many concurrent users can it handle until errors ensue?)

\begin_layout Standard
These services poll your site at regular or irregular intervals.
 This poses analysis problems: for example, if one your servers is very
 slow just at that one moment that any of these services requests a page,
 you will be told that there's a major issue with your site.
 But that's not necessarily true: it might be a fluke.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
No real-world browsers

\begin_layout Standard
Most, if not all of these services use their own custom clients 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 That implies their results aren't a representation of the real-world situation,
 which means you can't rely upon these metrics for making decisions: what
 if a commonly used real-world browser behaves completely differently? Even
 if the services would all use real-world browsers, they would never reflect
 real-world performance, because browser usage evolves over time and aren't
 the same for any two web sites.
\end_layout

The problem with these services is that they still assume the World Wide
 Web is the same as it was 10 years ago, where JavaScript was rather a scarcity

 for response time measurements.
 In Web 1.0, that was fine.
 But as the adoption of AJAX 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 has grown, the 
\family typewriter
onload
\family default
 event has become less and less representative of when the page is ready
 (i.e.
 has completely loaded), because the page can continue to load additional
 components.
 For some web sites, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

above the fold
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 section of a web page has been optimized, thereby loading

 content later, below the fold.
 Thus the

 is very much like Jiffy.
 There are two differences:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Episodes' goal is to become an industry standard.
 This would imply that the aforementioned 3rd party services (Gomez/Keynote/WebM
etrics/Pingdom) would take advantage of the the instrumentations implemented
 through Episodes in their anylises.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Most of the implementation is built into browsers (
\family typewriter
window.postMessage(),
\family default
 
\family typewriter
addEventListener()
\family default
), which means there is less code that must be downloaded.
 (Note: the newest versions of browsers are necessary: Internet Explorer
 8, Firefox 3, WebKit Nightlies and Opera 9.5.
 An additional backwards compatibility JavaScript file must be downloaded
 for older browsers.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve Souders outlines the goals and vision for Episodes succinctly in these
 two paragrahps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\emph on
The goal is to make Episodes the industrywide solution for measuring web
 page load times.

\emph default
 This is possible because Episodes has benefits for all the stakeholders.
 Web developers only need to learn and deploy a single framework.
 Tool developers and web metrics service providers get more accurate timing
 information by relying on instrumentation inserted by the developer of
 the web page.
 Browser developers gain insight into what's happening in the web page by
 relying on the context relayed by Episodes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Most importantly, users benefit by the adoption of Episodes.
 They get a browser that can better inform them of the web page's status
 for Web 2.0 apps.
 Since Episodes is a lighter weight design than other instrumentation frameworks
, users get faster pages.
 As Episodes makes it easier for web developers to shine a light on performance
 issues, 
\emph on
the end result is an Internet experience that is faster for everyone
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A couple of things can be said about the current codebase of Episodes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are two JavaScript files: 
\family typewriter
episodes.js
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
episodes-compat.js
\family default
.
 The latter is loaded on-the-fly when an older browser is being used that
 doesn't support 
\family typewriter
window.postMessage()
\family default
.
 These are operational but haven't had wide testing yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It uses the same query string syntax as Jiffy uses, which means Jiffy's
 Apache configuration, ingestor and reporting toolset can be reused, at
 least partially.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It has its own Firebug extension, see figure

 is to achieve a concensus on a JavaScript-based page loading instrumentation
 toolset.
 It aims to become an industry standard and is maintained by Steve Souders,
 who is currently on Google's payroll to work on all things page loading
 performance full-time (which suggests we might see integration with Google's

\begin_layout Standard
However, for the scope of this thesis, there is one tool that jumps out:
 YSlow.
 It allows you to carefully analyze which things Drupal could be doing better.
 It's not necessarily meaningful in real-world situations, because it e.g.
 only checks if you're using a CDN, not how fast that CDN is.
 However, the fact that it tests whether a CDN is being used (or Expired
 headers, or gzipped components, or …) is enough to find out what can be
 improved, to maximize the potential performance.

This kind of analysis is exactly what I'll perform in the next section:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is one more tool that jumps out for real, practical use: Episodes.
 This tool, if properly integrated with Drupal, would be a key asset to
 Drupal, because it would enable web site owners to track the real-world
 page loading performance.
 It would allow contributed module developers to support Episodes.
 This, in turn, would be a good indicator for a module's quality and would
 allow the web site owner/administrator/developer to carefully analyze each
 aspect of his Drupal web site.

To ensure that that also happens, I wrote the Episodes module

 This module integrates the Episodes framework for timing web pages (see
 section

) with Drupal on several levels – 
\emph on
all without modifying Drupal core

\begin_layout Itemize
Provides basic reports with charts to make sense of the collected data.

\begin_layout Standard
The Episodes module in fact contains two modules: the Episodes module and
 the Episodes Server module.
 The former is the

actual
\emph default
 integration and can be used without the latter.
 The latter can be installed on a separate Drupal web site (on a separate
 server) or on the same.
 It provides basic reports.
\end_layout

You could also choose to not enable the Episodes Server module and use an
 external web service to generate reports, but for now, none of these services
 exist yet.

Episodes module: integrating with Drupal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a brief overview with the highlights of what had to be done to integrate
 Drupal with the Episodes framework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Implemented 
\family typewriter
hook_install()
\family default
, through which I set a module weight of -1000.
 This ensures the hook implementations of this module are always executed
 before all others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Implemented 
\family typewriter
hook_init()
\family default
, which is invoked at the end of the Drupal bootstrap process.
 Through this hook I automatically insert the JavaScript into the 
\family typewriter
<head>
\family default
 tag that's necessary to make Episodes work (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sub:Episodes.module:reusable"

\end_inset

).
 Thanks to the extremely low module weight, the JavaScript code it inserts
 is the first tag in the 
\family typewriter
<head>
\family default
 tag.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Also through this same hook I add 
\family typewriter
Drupal.episodes.js
\family default
, which provides the actual integration with Drupal.
 It automatically creates an episode for each Drupal 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

behavior
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 (A behavior is written in JavaScript and adds interactivity to the web
 page.) Each time new content is added to the page through AHAH, 
\family typewriter
Drupal.attachBehaviors()
\family default
 is called and automatically attaches behaviors to new content, but not
 to existing content.
 Through 
\family typewriter
Drupal.episodes.js
\family default
, Drupal's default 
\family typewriter
Drupal.attachBehaviors()
\family default
 method is overridden – this is very easy in JavaScript.
 In this overridden version, each behavior is automatically measured as
 an episode.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Thanks to Drupal's existing abstraction and the override I've implemented,
 all JavaScript code can be measured through Episodes without hacking Drupal
 core.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

A simplified version of what it does can be seen in listing
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "lst:Drupal.attachBehaviors()"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Some of the Drupal behaviors are too meaningless to measure, so it'd be
 nice to be able to mark some of the behaviors as ignored.
 That's also something I implemented.
 Basically I do this by locating every directory in which one or more 
\family typewriter
*.js
\family default
 files exist, create a scan job for each of these and queue them in Drupal's
 Batch API 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Drupal Batch API"

\end_inset

.
 Each of these jobs scans each 
\family typewriter
*.js
\family default
 file, looking for behaviors.
 Every detected behavior is stored in the database and can be marked as
 ignored through a simple UI that uses the Hierarchical Select module 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Drupal Hierarchial Select"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For measuring the 
\family typewriter
css
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
headerjs
\family default
 episodes, it's necessary to make a couple of simple (copy-and-paste simple)
 changes to the 
\family typewriter
page.tpl.php
\family default
 of the Drupal theme(s) you're using.
 These changes are explained in the 
\family typewriter
README.txt
\family default
 file that ships with the Episodes module.
 This is the only manual change to code that 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 be done – it's recommended, but not required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
And of course a configuration UI (see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "fig:Episodes-module-settings-form"

\end_inset

 and figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 It ensures the beacon URL exists and is properly configured (i.e.

Episodes Server module: reports
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only basic reports are provided, highlighting the most important statistics
 and visualizing them through charts.
 Advanced/detailed reports are beyond the scope of this bachelor thesis,
 because they require extensive performance research (to be able to handle
 massive datasets), database indexing optimization and usability research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
First of all, the Apache HTTP server is a requirement, this application's
 logging component is used for generating the log files.
 Its logging component has been proven to be scalable, so there's no need
 to roll our own.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The source of this idea lies with Jiffy (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sub:Jiffy"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The user must make some changes to his 
\family typewriter
httpd.conf
\family default
 configuration file for his Apache HTTP server.
 As just mentioned, my implementation is derived from Jiffy's, yet every
 configuration line is different.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The ingestor parses the Apache log file and moves the data to the database.
 I was able to borrow a couple of regular expressions from Jiffy's ingestor
 (which is written in Perl …) but I rewrote it completely to be clean and
 simple code, conform the Drupal coding guidelines.
 It detects the browser, browser version and operating system from the User
 Agent that was logged with the help of the Browser.php library 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Browser.php"

\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This is guaranteed to work thanks to the included meticulous unit tests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For the reports, I used the Google Chart API 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 You can see the result in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
And of course again a configuration UI (see figure

Desired future features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to lack of time, the basic reports are … well … very basic.
 It'd be nice to have more charts and to be able to filter the data of the
 charts.
 In particular, these 3 filters would be very useful:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
filter by timespan: all time, 1 year, 6 months, 1 month, 1 week, 1 day
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
filter by browser and browser version
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
filter by (parts of) the URL

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Generating the back-end start time on the server can never work reliably
 because the clocks of the client (browser) and server are never perfectly
 in sync, which is required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Even just measuring the page execution time on the server cannot work because
 of this same reason.
 You 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 accurately measure this time, but you can't 
\emph on
relate
\emph default
 it to the measurements in the browser.
 I implemented this using implementations Drupal's 
\family typewriter
hook_boot()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
hook_exit()
\family default
 hooks and came to this conclusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On the first page load, the 
\family typewriter
onbeforeunload
\family default
 cookie is not yet set and therefor the 
\family typewriter
backend
\family default
 episode cannot be calculated, which in turn prevens the 
\family typewriter
pageready
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
totalti
\family default
me episodes from being calculated.
 This is of course also a problem when cookies are disabled, because then
 the 
\family typewriter
backend
\family default
 episode can 
\emph on
never
\emph default
 be calculated.
 There is no way around this until the day that browsers provide something
 like 
\family typewriter
document.requestTime
\family default
.

\begin_layout Itemize
Currently the same database as Drupal is being used.
 Is this scalable enough for analyzing the logs of web sites with millions
 of page views? No.
 Writing everything to a SQLite database wouldn't be better.
 The real solution is to use a different server to log to or even a web
 service.
 Better even is to log to a non-app server of your own and then send the
 logs to an external web service.
 Then you stay in control of all your data! (Avoiding vendor lock-in.) The
 main reason I opted for using the same database, is ease of development.

Daemon
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So now that we have the tools to accurately (or at least 
\emph on
representatively
\emph default
) measure the effects of using a CDN, we still have to start using a CDN.
 So, let's look at how we can make a web site use a CDN.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As explained in section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sec:Key-Properties-CDN"

\end_inset

, there are two very different methods for populating CDNs.
 Supporting pull is easy, supporting push is a lot of work.
 But if we want to avoid vendor lock-in, it's necessary to be able to transparen
tly switch between either pull or any of the transfer protocols for push.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And to avoid vendor lock-in even further, it's necessary that we can do
 the preprocessing ourselves (be that video transcoding, image optimization
 or anything else).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's why the meat of this thesis is about a daemon that makes it just
 as easy to use eith push or pull CDNs and that gives you full flexibility
 in what kind of preprocessing you would like to perform.
 All you will have to do to integrate your web site with a CDN is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
installing the daemon
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
tell it what to do by filling out a simple configuration file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
start the daemon
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
retrieve the URLs of the synced files from an SQLite database
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Goals
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:daemon:Goals"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As said before, the ability to use either push or pull CDNs is an absolute
 necessity, as is the ability to process files before they are synced to
 the CDN.
 However, there's more to it than just that, so here's a fill list of goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Easy to use: the configuration file is the interface and explain itself
 just by its structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Transparency: the transfer protocol(s) supported by the CDN should be irrelevant
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mixing CDNs and static ﬁle servers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Processing before sync: image optimization, video transcoding …
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Detect (& sync) new ﬁles instantly: through inotify on Linux, FSEvents on
 Mac OS X and the FindFirstChangeNotification AP or ReadDirectoryChanges
 API on Windows (there's also the FileSystemWatcher class for .NET)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Robustness: when the daemon is stopped (or when it crashed), it should know
 where it left off and sync all added, modified and deleted files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Scalable: syncing 1,000 or 1,000,000 files – and keeping them synced – should
 work just as well
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Unit testing wherever feasible
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Design for reuse wherever possible
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Low resource consumption (except for processors, which may be very demanding
 because of their nature)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No dependencies other than Python (but processors can have additional dependenci
es)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A couple of these goals need more explaining.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The transparency goal should speak for itself, but you may not yet have
 realized its impact: this is what will avoid high CDN provider switching
 costs, that is, it helps to avoid vendor lock-in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Detecting and syncing files instantly is a must to ensure CDN usage is as
 high as possible.
 If new files would only be detected every 10 minutes, then visitors, who
 might have uploaded images as part of the content they've created, will
 be downloading the image from the web server (or maybe static file server),
 which is suboptimal, considering that they could've been downloading it
 from the CDN.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ability to mix CDNs and static file servers makes it possible to either
 maximize the page loading performance or minimize the costs.
 Depending on your company's customerbase, you may either want to pay for
 a global CDN or a local one.
 If you're a global company, a global CDN makes sense.
 But if you're present only in a couple of countries, say the U.S.A., Japan
 and France, it doesn't make sense to pay for a global CDN.
 It's probably cheaper to pay for a North-American CDN and a couple of strategic
ally placed static file servers in Japan and France to cover the rest of
 your customer base.
 Without this daemon, this is rather hard to set up.
 With it however, it becomes child's play: all you have to do, is configure
 multiple destinations.
 That's all there is to it.
 It is then still up to you how you use these files, though.
 To decide from which server you will let your visitors download the files,
 you could look at the IP, or if your visitors must register, at the country
 they've set in their profile.
 This also allows for event-driven server allocation.
 For example if a big event is being hosted in Paris, you could temporarily
 hire another server in Paris to ensure low latency and high throughput.

Configuration file design
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:daemon:Configuration-file-design"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the configuration file is the interface and I had a good idea of the
 features I wanted to support, I started by writing a configuration file.
 That might be unorthodox, but in the end, this is the most important part
 of the daemon.
 If it's too hard to configure, nobody will use it.
 If it's easy to use, more people will be inclined to give it a try.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Judge for yourself how easy it is by looking at listing
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "lst:sample-config-file"

\end_inset

.
 Beneath the config root node, there are 3 child nodes, each for one of
 the 3 major sections:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
sources
\family default
: indicate each data source, in which new, modified and deleted files will
 be detected recursively.
 Each source has a name (that we will reference later in the configuration
 file) and of course a 
\family typewriter
scanPath
\family default
, which defines the root directory within which new/modified/deleted files
 will be detected.
 It can also optionally have the 
\family typewriter
documentRoot
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
basePath
\family default
 attributes, which may be necessary for some processors that perform magic
 with URLs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
servers
\family default
: provide the settings for all servers that will be used in this configuration.
 Each server has a 
\family typewriter
name
\family default
 and a 
\family typewriter
transporter
\family default
 that it should use.
 The child nodes of the 
\family typewriter
server
\family default
 node are the settings that are passed to that transporter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
rules
\family default
: this is the heart of the configuration file, since this is what determines
 what goes where.
 Each rule is associated with a source (via the 
\family typewriter
for
\family default
 attribute), must have a 
\family typewriter
label
\family default
 attribute and can consist (but doesn't have to!) of three parts:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
filter
\family default
: can contain 
\family typewriter
paths
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
extensions
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
ignoredDirs
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
pattern
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
size
\family default
 child nodes.
 The text values of these nodes will be used to filter the files that have
 been created, modified or deleted within the source to which this rule
 applies.
 If it's a match, then the rule will be applied (and therefor the processor
 chain and destination associated with it).
 Otherwise, this rule is ignored for that file.
 See the filter module (section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:daemon:modules:filter.py"

\end_inset

) explanation for details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
processorChain
\family default
: accepts any number of 
\family typewriter
processor
\family default
 nodes through which you reference (via the 
\family typewriter
name
\family default
 attribute) the procesor module and the specific processor class within
 that processor module that you'd like to use.
 They'll be chained in the order you specify here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
destinations
\family default
: accepts any number of 
\family typewriter
destination
\family default
 nodes through which you specify all servers to which the file should be
 transported.
 Each 
\family typewriter
destination
\family default
 node must have a 
\family typewriter
server
\family default
 attribute and can have a 
\family typewriter
path
\family default
 attribute.
 The 
\family typewriter
path
\family default
 attribute sets a parent path inside which the files will be transported.

\begin_layout Standard
This module provides the 
\family typewriter
Filter
\family default
 class.
 Through this class, you can check if a given file path matches a set of
 conditions.
 This class is used to determine which processors should be applied to a
 given file and to which CDN it should be synced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class has just 2 methods: 
\family typewriter
set_conditions()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
matches()
\family default
.
 There are 5 different conditions you can set.
 The last two should be used with care, because they are a lot slower than
 the first three.
 Especially the last one can be very slow, because it must access the file
 system.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If there are several valid options within a single condition, a match with
 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 of them is sufficient (OR).
 Finally, 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 conditions must be satisfied (AND) before a given file path will result
 in a positive match.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The five conditions are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
paths
\family default
: a list of paths (separated by colons) in which the file can reside
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
extensions
\family default
: a list of extensions (separated by colons) the file can have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
ignoredDirs
\family default
: a list of directories (separated by colons) that should be ignored, meaning
 that if the file is inside one of those directories, 
\family typewriter
Filter
\family default
 will mark this as a negative match – this is useful to ignore data in typical
 
\family typewriter
CVS
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
.svn
\family default
 directories
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\begin_layout Subsubsection
pathscanner.py
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:daemon:modules:pathscanner.py"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As is to be expected, this module provides the 
\family typewriter
PathScanner
\family default
 class, which scans paths and stores them in a SQLite 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SQLite"

\end_inset

 database.
 You can use 
\family typewriter
PathScanner
\family default
 to detect changes in a directory structure.
 For efficiency, only creations, deletions and modifications are detected,
 not moves.
 This class is used to scan the file system for changes when no supported
 filesystem monitor is installed on the current operating system.
 It is also used for persistent storage: when the daemon has been stopped,
 the database built and maintained through/by this class is used as a reference,
 to detect changes that have happened before it was started again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The database schema is very simple: (
\family typewriter
path
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
filename
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
mtime
\family default
).
 Directories are also stored; in that case, 
\family typewriter
path
\family default
 is the path of the parent directory, 
\family typewriter
filename
\family default
 is the directory name and 
\family typewriter
mtime
\family default
 is set to -1.
 Modified files are detected by looking comparing the current mtime with
 the value stored in the 
\family typewriter
mtime
\family default
 column.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Changes to the database are committed in batches, because changes in the
 filesystem typically occur in batches as well.
 If every change would be committed separately, the concurrency level would
 rise unnecessarily.
 By default, every batch of 50 changes are committed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class provides you with 8 methods:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
initial_scan()
\family default
 to build the initial database – works recursively
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
scan()
\family default
 to get the changes – doesn't work recursively
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
scan_tree()
\family default
 (uses 
\family typewriter
scan()
\family default
) to get the changes in an entire directory structure – obviously works
 recursively
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
purge_path()
\family default
 to purge all the metadata for a path from the database
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
add_files(),
\family default
 
\family typewriter
update_files()
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
remove_files()
\family default
 to add/update/remove files manually (useful when your application has more/fast
er knowledge of changes)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This module doesn't have any tests yet, because it requires 
\emph on
a lot
\emph default
 of mock functions to simulate system calls.
 It's been tested manually thoroughly though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
fsmonitor.py
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:daemon:modules:fsmonitor.py"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This time around, there's more to it than it seems.
 
\family typewriter
fsmonitor.py
\family default
 provides 
\family typewriter
FSMonitor
\family default
, a base class from which subclasses derive.
 
\family typewriter
fsmonitor_inotify.py
\family default
 has the 
\family typewriter
FSMonitorInotify
\family default
 class, 
\family typewriter
fsmonitor_fsevents.py
\family default
 has 
\family typewriter
FSMonitorFSEvents
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
fsmonitor_polling.py
\family default
 has 
\family typewriter
FSMonitorPolling
\family default
.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Put these together, and you have a single, simple to use abstraction to
 use each operating system's file system monitor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Uses inotify 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 on Linux (kernel 2.6.13 and higher)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_inset

 on Mac OS X (10.5 and higher)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Falls back to polling when neither one is present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Windows support is possible, but hasn't been implemented yet due to time
 constraints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Implementation obstacles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make this class work consistently, less critical features that are only
 available for specific file system monitors are abstracted away.
 And other features are emulated.
 It comes down to the fact that 
\family typewriter
FSMonitor
\family default
's API is very simple to use and only supports 5 different events: 
\family typewriter
CREATED
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
MODIFIED
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
DELETED
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
MONITORED_DIR_MOVED
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
DROPPED_EVENTS
\family default
.
 The last 2 events are only triggered for inotify and FSEvents.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

A persistent mode is also supported, in which all metadata is stored in
 a database.
 This allows you to even track changes when your program wasn't running.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see, only 3 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 events of interest are supported: the most common ones.
 This is because not every API supports all features of the other APIs.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

inotify is the most complete in this regard: it supports a boatload of different
 events, on a file-level.
 But it only provides realtime events: it doesn't maintain a complete history
 of events.
 And that's understandable: it's impossible to maintain a history of 
\emph on
every
\emph default
 file system event.
 Over time, there wouldn't be any space left to store actual data.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

FSEvents on the other hand, works on the directory-level, so you have to
 maintain your own directory tree state to detect created, modified and
 deleted files.
 It only triggers a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a change has occurred in this directory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 event.
 This is why for example there is no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

file moved
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 event: it'd be too resource-intensive to detect that, or at the very least
 it wouldn't scale.
 On the plus side, FSEvents maintains a complete history of events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Implementations that don't support file-level events (FSEvents and polling)
 are persistent by design.
 Because the directory tree state must be maintained to be able to trigger
 the correct events, 
\family typewriter
PathScanner
\family default
 (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:daemon:modules:pathscanner.py"

\end_inset

) is used for storage.
 They use 
\family typewriter
PathScanner
\family default
's 
\family typewriter
(add|update|remove)_files()
\family default
 functions to keep the database up-to-date.
 And because the entire directory tree state is always stored, you can compare
 the current directory tree state with the stored one to detect changes,
 either as they occur (by being notified of changes on the directory level)
 or as they have occurred (by scanning the directory tree manually).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the persistent mode, we could take advantage of 
\family typewriter
FSEvents
\family default
' ability to look back in time.
 However, again due to time constraints, the same approach is used for every
 implementation: a manual scanning procedure – using 
\family typewriter
PathScanner
\family default
 – is started after the file system monitor starts listening for new events
 on a given path.
 That way, no new events are missed.
 This works equally well as using FSEvents' special support for this: it's
 just slower.
 But it's sufficient for now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
persistent_queue.py and persistent_list.py
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to provide data persistency , I wrote the 
\family typewriter
PersistentQueue
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
PersistentList
\family default
 classes.
 As their names indicate, these provide you with a persistent queue and
 a persistent list.
 They use again an SQLite database for persistent storage.
 For each instance you create, you must choose the table name and you can
 optionally choose which database file to write to.
 This allows you to group persistent datastructures in a logical manner
 (i.e.
 related persistent datastructures can be stored in the same database file,
 thereby also making it portable and easy to backup).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To prevent excessive file system access due to an overreliance on SQLite,
 I also added in-memory caching.
 To ensure low resource consumption, only the first X items in 
\family typewriter
PersistentQueue
\family default
 are cached in-memory (a minimum and maximum treshold can be configured)
 , but for 
\family typewriter
PersistentList
\family default
 there is no such restriction: it's cached in-memory in its entirety.
 It's not designed for large datasets, but 
\family typewriter
PersistentQeueue
\family default
 is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first question to arise is: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why use SQLite in favor of Python's built-in 
\family typewriter
shelve
\family default
 module?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Well, the answer is simple: aside of the benefit of the ability to have
 all persistent data in a single file, it must also scale to tens of thousands
 or even millions of files.
 
\family typewriter
shelve
\family default
 isn't scalable because its data is loaded into memory in its entirety.
 This could easily result in hundreds of megabytes of memory usage.
 Such excessive memory usage should be avoided at all costs when the target
 environment is a (web) server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your next question would probably be: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How can you be sure the SQLite database won't get corrupt?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The answer is: we can't.
 But the same applies to Python's 
\family typewriter
shelve
\family default
 module.
 However, the aforementioned advantages of SQLite give plenty of advantages
 over 
\family typewriter
shelve
\family default
.
 Plus, SQLite is thoroughly tested, even against corruption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SQLite testing"

\end_inset

.
 It's also used for very large datasets and by countless companies.
 So it's the best bet you can make.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, you'd probably ask 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why not use MySQL or PostgreSQL or …?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Again the answer is brief: because SQLite requires no additional setup
 because it is 
\emph on
serverless
\emph default
, as opposed to MySQL and PostgreSQL.

\begin_layout Standard
This module provides several classes: 
\family typewriter
Processor
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
ProcessorChain
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
ProcessorChainFactory
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
Processor
\family default
 is a base class for processors, which are designed to be easy to write
 yourself.
 Processors receive an input file, do something with it and return the output
 file.
 The 
\family typewriter
Processor
\family default
 class takes a lot of the small annoying tasks on its shoulders, such as
 checking if the file is actually a file this processor can process, calculating
 the default output file and a simple abstraction around an otherwise multi-line
 construction to run a command.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Upon completion, a callback will be called.
 Another callback is called in case of an error.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

An example can found in listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "lst:Processors-YUICompressor"

\end_inset

.
 For details, please consult the daemon's documentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Processors are allowed to make any change they want to the file's contents.
 They are also allowed to change the base name of the input file, but they're
 not allowed to change its path.
 This measure was taken to reduce the amount of data that will need to be
 stored to know which file is stored where exactly.
 This is enforced 
\emph on
by convention
\emph default
, because in Python it's impossible to truly enforce anything.
 If you do change the path, the file will sync just fine, but it will be
 impossible to delete the old version of a modified file, unless it results
 in the exact same path and base name each time it runs through the processor
 chain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
Processor
\family default
 class accepts a parent logger which subclasses can optionally use to perform
 logging.

Then there is the

\begin_layout Enumerate

RequestToRequeueException
\family default
: when raised, the

\family default
 will stop processing this file and will pretend the processing failed.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 So it must be retried later.

 MTime appends the mtime (last modification time) as a UNIX timestamp to

 It optimizes images losslessly, i.e.

 was thoroughly laid out in a series of blog posts

 PNG8 offers lossless image quality, as does GIF, but results in a smaller

 PNG8 is also supported in all browsers, including IE6.
 It's the alpha channels of truecolor PNG (PNG24 & PNG32) that are not supported
 in IE6.

JPEG files can be optimized in three complementary ways: stripping metadata,
 optimizing the Huffman tables and making them progressive.
 There are two variations to store a JPEG file: baseline and progresive.
 A baseline JPEG file is stored as one top-to-bottom scan, whereas a progressive
 JPEG file is stored as a series of scans, with each scan gradually improving
 the quality of the overall image.
 Stoyan Stefanov's tests 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "imageopt-4"

\end_inset

 have pointed out that you've got a 75% chance that the JPEG file is best
 saved as baseline when it's smaller than 10 KB.
 For JPEG files larger than 10 KB, it's 94% likely that progressive JPEG
 will result in a better compression ratio.
 That's why the third optimization (making JPEG files progressive) is only
 applied when the file is larger than 10 KB.
 All these optimizations are applied using jpegtran

One nuance you should know about: stripping metadata may also remove the
 copyright information, which may have legal consequences.
 So you better don't strip metadata when you've bought some of the photos
 you're hosting, which may be the case for e.g.
 a newspaper web site.

 If one of the referenced files cannot be found on the file system, this
 URL remains unchanged.

Since Django is a pretty big open source project with many developers and
 is powering many web sites, it's fair to assume that the API is stable
 and solid.
 Reinventing the wheel is meaningless and will just introduce more bugs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Because the daemon relies on (unmodified!) Django code, it can benefit from
 bugfixes/features applied to Django's code and can use custom storage systems
 written for Django.
 The opposite is also true: changes made by contributors to the daemon (and
 initially myself) can be contributed back to Django and its contributed
 custom storage systems.

For the last two, transporters are available.
 The first three are not so widely used and thus not yet implemented, although
 it'd be very easy to support them, exactly because all that is necessary,
 is to write thin wrappers.
 The fourth is not very meaningful to use, since the fifth is better (better
 maintained and better performing).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I clearly managed to make a big shortcut (for simplicity of the argument,
 I'm waving away the fact that I had to get this to work outside of Django
 itself) to achieve my goal: support CDNs that support FTP or origin pulling
 (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sec:Key-Properties-CDN"

\end_inset

), as well as the Amazon S3 and CloudFront CDNs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, supporting origin pull was trickier than would seem at first.
 Normally, you just rewrite your URLs and be done with it.
 However, I wanted to support processing files prior to syncing them to
 the CDN.
 And I want to keep following the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

don't touch the original file
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rule.
 With push, that is no problem, you just process the file, store the output
 file in a temporary directory, push the file and delete it afterwards.
 But what about pull?
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

I had to be creative here.
 Since files must remain available for origin pull (in case the CDN wants/needs
 to update its copy), all files must be copied to another publicly accessible
 path in the web site.
 But what about files that are not modified? Or have just changed filenames
 (for unique URLs)? Copying these means storing the exact same data twice.
 The answer is fortunately very simple: symlinks.
 Although available only on UNIX, it's very much worth it: it reduces redundant
 data storage significantly.
 This was then implemented in a new custom storage system: 
\family typewriter
SymlinkOrCopyStorage
\family default
, which copies modified files and symlinks unmodified ones.

The

 header is set automatically via guessing based on the extension, this is
 done through mimetypes.guesstype.
 Right now, no Content-Type is set, and therefor the default binary mimetype
 is set: application/octet- stream.
 This causes browsers to download files instead of displaying them.
\end_layout

The ACL now actually gets applied properly to the bucket and to each file
 that is saved to the bucket.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Currently, URLs are generated with query-based authentication (meaning you'll
 get ridiculously long URLs) and HTTPS is used instead of HTTP, thereby
 preventing browsers from caching files.
 I've disabled query authentication and HTTPS, as this is the most common
 use case for serving files.
 This probably should be configurable, but that can be done in a revised
 patch or a follow-up patch.

 So the pid must be stored in a file somewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This module contains the 
\family typewriter
DaemonThreadRunner
\family default
 class, which accepts an object and the name of the file that should contain
 the pid.
 The object should be a subclass of Python's 
\family typewriter
threading.Thread
\family default
 class.
 As soon as you 
\family typewriter
start()
\family default
 the 
\family typewriter
DaemonThreadRunner
\family default
 object, the pid will be written to the specified pid file name, the object
 will be marked as a daemon thread and started.
 While it's running, the pid is written to the pid file every 60 seconds.

\begin_layout Standard
When an interrupt is caught (
\family typewriter
SIGINT
\family default
 for interruption, 
\family typewriter
SIGTSTP

SIGTERM
\family default

 and 
\family typewriter
DaemonThreadRunner
\family default
 waits for the thread to join and then deletes the file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This module is not unit tested, because it makes very little sense to do
 so (there's not much code).
 Having used it hundreds of times, it didn't fail once, so it's reliable
 enough.

The Big Picture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The arbitrator is what links together all Python modules I've described
 in the previous section.
 Here's a hierarchical overview, so you get a better understanding of The
 Big Picture:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, 
\family typewriter
Arbitrator
\family default
 is what links everything together: it controls the 5 components: 
\family typewriter
Config
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
FSMonitor
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
Filter
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
Processor
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
Transporter
\family default
.
 There are three subclasses of 
\family typewriter
FSMonitor
\family default
 to take advantage of the platform's built-in file system monitor.
 
\family typewriter
Processor
\family default
 must be subclassed for every processor.
 
\family typewriter
Transporter
\family default
 must be subclassed for each protocol.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that you have an insight in the Big Picture, let's see how exactly 
\family typewriter
Arbitrator
\family default
 controls all components, and what happens before the 
\family typewriter
main
\family default
 function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The flow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, an 
\family typewriter
Arbitrator
\family default
 object is created and its constructor does the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
create a logger
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
parse the configuration file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
verify the existence of all processors and transporters that are referenced
 from the configuration file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
connect to each server (as defined in the configuration file) to ensure
 it's working
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, the 
\family typewriter
Arbitrator
\family default
 object is passed to a 
\family typewriter
DaemonThreadRunner
\family default
 object, which then runs the arbitrator in such a way that it can be stopped
 through signals.
 The arbitrator is then started.
 The following happens:
\end_layout

\end_layout

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
That's 
\emph on
roughly
\emph default
 the logic of the daemon.
 It should already make sense to you, but you're probably wondering what
 all the queues are for.
 And how they're being filled and emptied.
 So now it's time to learn about the daemon's 
\emph on
pipeline
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Pipeline design pattern
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This design pattern, which is also sometimes called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Filters and Pipes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "pipes-and-filters-1,pipes-and-filters-2,pipes-and-filters-3,pipes-and-filters-4"

\end_inset

, is slightly underdocumented, but it's still a very useful design pattern.
 Its premise is to deliver an architecture to divide a large processing
 task into smaller, sequential steps (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Filters
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) that can be performed independently – and therefor in parallel – which
 are finally connected via Pipes.
 The output of one step is the input of the next.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In my case, files are discovered and are then put into the pipeline queue.
 When they actually move into the pipeline (at which point they're added
 to the 'files in pipeline' persistent list), they start by going into the
 filter queue, after being filtered they go into the process queue (possibly
 more than once), after being processed to the transport queue (again possibly
 more than once), after being transported to the db queue, after being stored
 in the database, they're removed from the 'files in pipeline' persistent
 list and we're done for this file.
 Repeat for every discovered file.
 This is the 
\emph on
core logic
\emph default
 of the daemon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So many queues are used because there are so many stages in the pipeline.
 There's a queue for each stage in the pipeline, plus some additional ones
 because the persistent datastructures use the pysqlite module, which only
 allows you to access the database from the same thread as the connection
 was created in.
 Because I (have to) work with callbacks, the calling thread may be different
 from the creating thread, and therefor there are several queues that exist
 solely for exchanging data between threads.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

There is one persistent queue and two persistent lists.
 The persistent queue is the pipeline queue, which contains all files that
 are queued to be sent through the pipeline.
 The first persistent list is 'files in pipeline'.
 It is used to ensure files still get processed if the daemon was killed
 (or crashed) while they were in the pipeline.
 The second persistent list is 'failed files' and contains all files for
 which either a processor in the processor chain or a transporter failed.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

When the daemon is restarted, the contents of the 'files in pipeline' and
 'failed files' lists are pushed into the pipeline queue, after which they
 are erased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Queues are either filled through the 
\family typewriter
Arbitrator
\family default
 (because it moves data from one queue to the next):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on

\emph default
 queue is filled by the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

process 
\emph on
discover
\emph default

\end_inset

 method, which always syncs all files in the discover queue to the pipeline
 queue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on

\emph default
 queue is filled by the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

process

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 method, which processes up to 20 files (this is configurable) in one run,
 or until there are 100 files in the pipeline (this is also configurable),
 whichever limit is hit first.
\end_layout

or through callbacks (in case data gets processed in a separate thread):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
discover
\emph default
 queue is filled through 
\family typewriter
FSMonitor
\family default
's callback (which gets called for every discovered file).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on

\emph default
 queue is filled through a

ProcessorChain
\family default
's callback or directly from the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

process 
\emph on
filter
\emph default
 queue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 method (if the rule has no processor chain associated with it).
 To know when a file has been synced to all its destinations, the 'remaining
 transporters' list gets a new key (the concatenation of the input file,
 the event and the string representation of the rule) and the value of that
 key is a list of all servers to which this file will be synced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
db
\emph default
 queue is filled through a 
\family typewriter
Transporter
\family default
's callback.
 Each time this callback fires, it also carries information on which server
 the file has just been transported to.
 This server is then removed from the 'remaining transporters' list for
 this file.
 When no servers are left in this list, the sync is complete and the file
 can be removed from the 'files in pipeline' persistent list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the 
\family typewriter
ProcessorChain
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
Transporter
\family default
 callbacks only carry information about the file they've just been operating
 on, I had to find an elegant method to transfer the additional metadata
 for this file, which is necessary to let the file continue through the
 pipeline.
 I've found this in the form of currying
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "currying"

\end_inset

.
 Currying is dynamically creating a new function that calls another function,
 but with some arguments already filled out.
 An example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\scriptsize}"
inline true
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

curried_callback = curry(self.processor_chain_callback, event=event, rule=rule)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The function 
\family typewriter
self.processor_chain_callback
\family default
 accepts the 
\family typewriter
event
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
rule
\family default
 arguments, but the 
\family typewriter
ProcessorChain
\family default
 class has no way of accepting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

additional data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 arguments.
 So instead of rewriting 
\family typewriter
ProcessorChain
\family default
 (and the exact same thing applies to 
\family typewriter
Transporter
\family default
), I simply create a curried callback, that will automatically fill out
 the arguments that the 
\family typewriter
ProcessorChain
\family default
 callback by itself could never fill out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

process 
\emph on
X
\emph default
 queue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 methods acquires 
\family typewriter
Arbitrator
\family default
's lock before accessing any of the queues.
 
\emph on
Before
\emph default
 a file is removed from the pipeline queue, it is added to the 'files in
 pipeline' persistent list (this is possible thanks to 
\family typewriter
PersistentQueue
\family default
's 
\family typewriter
peek()
\family default
 method), and then it is removed from the pipeline queue.
 This implies that at no time after the file has been added to the pipeline
 queue, it can be lost.
 The worst case scenario is that the daemon crashes between adding the file
 to the 'files in pipeline' persistent list and removing it from the pipeline
 queue.
 Then it'll end up twice in the queue.
 But the second sync will just overwrite the first one, so all that is lost,
 is CPU time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

allow retry
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 method allows failed files (in the 'failed files' persistent list) to be
 retried, by adding them back to the pipeline queue.
 This happens whenever the pipeline queue is getting empty, or every 30
 seconds.
 This ensures processors that use the 
\family typewriter
RequestToRequeueException
\family default
 exception can retry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only truly weak link is unavoidable: if the daemon crashes somewhere
 between having performed the callback from 
\family typewriter
FSMonitor
\family default
, adding that file to the discover queue and syncing the file from the discover
 queue to the pipeline queue (which is necessary due to the thread locality
 restriction of pysqlite).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Performance tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I've performed fairly extensive tests in both Mac OS X and Linux.
 The application behaved identically on both platforms, despite the fact
 that different file system monitors are being used in the background.
 The rest of this problemless cross-platform functioning is thanks to Python.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All tests were performed on the local network, i.e.
 with a FTP server running on the localhost.
 Very small scale tests have been performed with the Amazon S3 and CloudFront
 transporters, and since they worked, the results should apply to those
 as well.
 It doesn't and shouldn't matter which transporter is being used.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At all times, the memory usage remained below 17 MB on Mac OS X and below
 7 MB on Linux (unless the update_linker processor module was used, in which
 case it leaks memory like a madman – the 
\family typewriter
cssutils
\family default
 Python module is to blame).
 A backlag of more than 10,000 files was no problem.
 Synchronizing 10 GB of files was no problem.
 I also tried alot of variations in the configuration and all of them worked
 (well, sometimes it needed s.ome bugfixing of course).
 Further testing should happen in real-world environments.
 Even tests in which I forced processors or transporters to crash were completed
 succesfully: no files were lost and they would be synced again after restarting
 the daemon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Possible further optimizations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Files should be moved from the discover queue to the pipeline queue in a
 separate thread, to minimize the risk of losing files due to a crashed
 application before files are moved to the pipeline queue.
 In fact, the discover queue could be eliminitated altogether thanks to
 this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Track progress of transporters and allow them to be be stopped while still
 syncing a file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Make processors more error resistent by allowing them to check the environment,
 so they can ensure 3rd party applications, such as YUI Compressor or jpegtran
 are installed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Figure out an automated way of ensuring the correct operating of processors,
 since they are most likely the cause of problems thanks to the fact that
 users can easily write their own Processors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Automatically copy the synced files DB every X seconds, to prevent long
 delays for read-only clients.
 This will only matter on sites where uploads happen more than once per

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Support for Munin/Nagios for monitoring (strongly related to the previous

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Store characteristics of the operations, such as TTS (Time-To-Sync), so
 that you can analyze this data to configure the daemon to better suit your
 needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Allow server-specific processor chains (i.e.
 run the processor chain once for each server the file will be synced to).
 This allows you to have CSS files that contain URLs rewritten to that specific
 server.
 Right now, you can only have 
\emph on
one 
\emph default
processor chain and therefor the CSS file will always reference the same
 URLs, which may refer to another server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cache the latest configuration file and compare with the new one.
 If changes occurred to any of the rules, it should detect them on its own
 and do the necessary resyncing.
